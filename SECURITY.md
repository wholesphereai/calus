# Security Policy

## 1. Purpose

This Security Policy outlines the process for reporting security vulnerabilities in the Calus project (detection engine, proxy gateway, and dashboard) and defines expectations for responsible disclosure.

Calus is **detection-only** by design: the proxy observes and flags traffic but never blocks or alters it. Provider API keys are never written to the call log; saved keys are encrypted at rest and only decrypted in memory to forward a request; secrets and PII are redacted before any text is stored.

## 2. Supported Versions

Security updates are provided only for the latest stable release.

| Version                | Supported |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Latest stable release  | ✅ Yes     |
| Older versions         | ❌ No      |

Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest version to receive security fixes.

## 3. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Submit reports via email:

- mohithkarthikeya28@gmail.com  
- rishi.thippan@gmail.com  

Please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce the issue  
- Affected versions  
- Potential impact  
- Proof-of-concept code (if applicable)  

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours.

## 4. Responsible Disclosure

We request that researchers:

- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before a fix is released.  
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary for proof-of-concept.  
- Allow reasonable time for remediation.  

We commit to:

- Investigating all legitimate reports.  
- Releasing patches in a timely manner.  
- Crediting reporters where appropriate.  

## 5. Scope

This policy applies only to:

- The Calus detection engine (`calus/`)

- The Calus dashboard (`dashboard/`)
- Official CLI tools and integrations  

This policy does NOT cover:

- Third-party dependencies  
- User misconfiguration
